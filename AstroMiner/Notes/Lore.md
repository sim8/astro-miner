# Oizus

Oizus is a asteroid-mining game in which you launch to passing asteroids, mine precious minerals and delve as deep as
you dare, and jump off the asteroid before the time runs out. Minerals can be sold or used to improve your equipment,
enabling you to launch to further asteroids and find more exotic resources. In exploring the world, you may find all is
not as it seems with the asteroids, and start to uncover something bigger than just rocks flying through space.

## The moon Oizus

Oizus is a moon of the *main faction* homeworld of *unnamed*. Once an exciting holiday destination where one could
marvel at the rocks flying past, the asteroids are now coming too close to Oizus, and it's now far too dangerous a place
to visit. The few who remain are those who've always lived here love it too much to leave, and the miners, attracted to
the thrill and riches of asteroid-mining.
