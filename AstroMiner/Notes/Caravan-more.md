- Player starts as rookie (head miner)
  - Better for storytelling
  - Responsible for mining operations and shop management

- Gem Caravan

## Game Structure

### Core Loop

The caravan moves continually round the traderoute of the 4 planets. Each planet, there's a travelling phase, an option to launch mining missions while in orbit of the planet, and the planet stop itself.

1. Travel between planets
   - Cutscenes can happen aboard the ship
   - Player can go to sleep to skip to planet
   - Potential activities on the ship
     - Crew interactions
     - Card games?
     - Decoration
     - Outfit changes
     - Upgrades to mining vehicle in the vehicle bay
2. Asteroid mining missions
   - After player has slept, will be in orbit of planet, and can launch mining mission from vehicle bay
   - Potentially pick a member of the team to join on missions?
3. Planet Stops
   - Selling gems
     - Slider for sell quantity with dynamic pricing?
     - Individual offer system?
     - Gems treated as pure currency
   - Visit merchants
     - Explosives
     - Repair supplies
     - Clothes
     - Equipment
   - Interact with quest NPCs?
   - Ship upgrades

### Economy System
- Planet-specific demand
  - Industrial planets prefer industrial-use gems
  - Rich residential areas want fashion/precious stones
- Dynamic pricing based on:
  - Supply over time
  - Special events
  - Recent visits
- Regional demand variations

## Merchant system

- What is the gem sale system?
  - Regular buy/sell e.g. most games
    - Pros
      - Simplest. No learning curve
    - Cons
      - Would mean combining ship/personal inventory
        - Is this really a bad thing? Going to have combined money anyway? 
        - Don't necessarily need to combine, could show up as separate section?
  - Accept/reject individual offers
    - Kinda gross
  - Set prices ahead of time in a table view (?). Price could go up/down depending on quantity
    - Pros
      - Easy to show supply/demand
      - Opportunities to incorporate luck. E.g. proceeds are estimates until you "fast forward" day of sales
    - Cons
      - Separate UI to learn
      - Is it actually fun?
- Should gems for sale be part of your regular inventory?
- Maybe should continue with regular buy/sell, with separate mechanics for contracts?
