# Caravan ideas

- Join a caravan
- Move between different locations, selling enmasse
- Are the caravan all gem traders?
  - Yes
    - What are they all doing on board? Pilot, captain, other miners? Ship maintenance?
    - OR are they competitors? Doesn't HAVE to feel competitive
    - More organic to grow crew
    - Are you captain or rookie?
      - Captain
        - Lots of decisions to make? Trade route?
      - Rookie
        - Probably better for story
        - Feels weird to be in charge of the shop? Or is it weird?
        - Feels weird to be in charge of money too
  - No
    - More interesting?
    - How do asteroid missions work?
- Is trading route predetermined?
- Economy (? - could be very headachey. Worth it?)
  - Planets inherently have different demand
    - Industrial planet - gems with industrial uses
    - Rich residential - fashion, precious stones
  - Set prices / estimated demand?
  - Demand dependent on supply over time
  - Affected by events
  - Auto set prices?
- Misc ideas
  - Name your trading company
  - Play cards with crew
  - Go to sleep to fast travel

## Game loop

- Land on planet
  - Sell gems (gems are pure currency, no reason to hold on to them. Different treatment in inventory?)
    - Set max number to sell? Set prices?
    - Accept individual offers?
    - Slider to set sell quantity, avg. price is dynamic? (less for higher quant)
    - Could there be some randomness in there?
  - Visit other merchants
    - Explosives
    - Repair supplies?
    - Clothes?
    - Equipment
  - Quest NPCs
  - Ship upgrades
- Ship
  - Launch asteroid missions - during or between stops?
    - during
      - Easier story to tell - relies on gravity
      - Can have different backgrounds
      - How would this work gameplay wise?
        - Sleep - In orbit "x" planet
        - Have the option to launch mission or "touch down"
        - THEN go to market
        - THEN return to ship "leave x?"
    - between
      - A litle better for the game flow - mining happens between stops
      - Why is there a time limit?
        - Not retrievable by vehicle?
        - Could orbit uninhabited planets / random black holes?
  - Cutscenes - move story forward
  - Chat to crew
    - Card games?
  - Decorate?
  - Change outfit
  - Go to sleep - progress time
  - Minigames?

## Game opening
- Character creation
  - Name
  - Looks
  - Background?
- Opening cutscene
  - Read a letter?
    - {name},
    - It was great meeting you last week! I chatted to the crew and if you're willing, we'd love for you to join us as Head Miner. We'll be on Krevik next week and can pick you up from the docks. What do you say?
    - Rikus
    - PS - I pray you've forgiven me for spilling milkshake on your suit. We have a very powerful washer onboard if you need it.
  - On the docks
    - Hello {name}! Good to see you again!
    - It's my pleasure to welcome you aboard The Archibald. I hope it serves as a satisfactory home in between trading stops.
    - Before you meet the crew, I wanted to ask if there's anything you didn't get to ask last time we met?
      - What are my responsibilities?
        - As Head Miner, you'll lead the asteroid mining missions - which involves driving the MV, mining gems, and trying not to die! Heh!
        - You'll also help run the shop when we're on the ground.
      - Where are we headed?
        - I believe our next stop is Astris. Our pilot, Sillus, can talk you through the trade route.
      - I don't have any more questions.
  - Introduce yourself to everyone
  - When finished, go to room. Wake up in orbit of next planet
  - Have breakfast in mess hall?
  - Go on first mission
- Alternative intros
  - Hired? Interview?
