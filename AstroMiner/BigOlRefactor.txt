# BIG REFACTOR PLAN

- Keep grid!
  - Have a virtual "world" class
  - Some abstraction for interacting with each grid
  - Override logic for things like collisions
  - Look through the code, check that makes sense
- In the short term, keep separate entities, focus on keeping code tidy


Separate PR:

- Full blown performant ECS for everything else, including active cells
  - start with entities shared between both worlds
  - Start with just one entity (e.g. dynamite)
  - Aim to remove old active entities
  - Aim to move active cells into entities

Future looking

- InteriorsWorld?
- Sub layer of asteroid world?
